afx-fusion-plugins
================

## Requirements
* [Intel IPP](https://registrationcenter.intel.com/en/forms/?productid=2558) (Free Community Licensing)
* [BOOST](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/)
* [Fusion SDK](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=102128)

### NOTE:

Authority FX compositing plugins were developed for Eyeon Fusion 6, circa 2012.
They have not been maintained since Fusion was acquired by Blackmagic.

These plugins are made available at the request of artists who would like to use
them in Blackmagic Fusion.

### TODO

* Update to compile with latest Blackmagic Fusion SDK
* Remove licensing code
* Port features from https://github.com/AuthorityFX/afx-nuke-plugins
